    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is NFC Tap-to-Pay?</h2>
      <p>
        NFC (Near Field Communication) is a short-range wireless technology that lets a payment card or device
        communicate with a terminal when you hold it close. For credit cards, NFC enables
        <strong>contactless payments</strong> – you tap the card on the terminal instead of inserting it.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the bank’s perspective, a contactless transaction is still a normal card payment. What changes is
        <strong>how</strong> card data is transmitted, how the terminal verifies it, and which security rules
        apply for low-value taps vs. higher amounts that may still require a PIN or other authentication.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same basic idea is used for phone and watch wallets, but with an extra layer of
        <strong>tokenisation</strong> and device authentication on top.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>Contactless Transaction Flow in Practice</h2>
      <p>
        When you tap your card on a terminal, a few key steps happen within seconds:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The terminal energises the NFC chip and requests payment data.</li>
        <li>The chip sends a <strong>limited set of card details</strong> plus a transaction-specific cryptogram.</li>
        <li>The terminal may perform basic checks (amount, currency, risk parameters).</li>
        <li>The transaction is sent through the card network to your issuer for authorization.</li>
        <li>The issuer validates the cryptogram and risk rules, then approves or declines.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For phone or watch wallets, the NFC interface is similar, but the “card” presented to the terminal is
        usually a <strong>device-specific token</strong> instead of your actual card number.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Security -->
    <section id="security" class="section">
      <h2>Security Features Behind a Tap</h2>
      <p>
        Contactless transactions are designed with multiple security layers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Short range:</strong> NFC requires very close proximity, making long-distance interception
          impractical under normal use.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dynamic cryptograms:</strong> Each transaction includes a one-time cryptographic value, so
          copying the radio signal does not normally let someone replay it later.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Risk controls:</strong> Issuers and terminals apply rules based on amount, frequency, geography
          and merchant type.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wallet authentication (for devices):</strong> Phones and watches typically require biometric
          or PIN unlock before they can present a payment token.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Contactless payments share the same basic protections as other card transactions, including the ability
        to dispute fraudulent charges and request chargebacks under your local rules.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Limits & Edge Cases -->
    <section id="limits" class="section">
      <h2>Limits, PIN Prompts &amp; Offline Transactions</h2>
      <p>
        Many regions apply specific rules and limits to NFC payments. These can include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Per-transaction limits:</strong> Above a certain amount, the terminal may require you to insert
          the card and enter a PIN instead of allowing a tap.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cumulative limits:</strong> After a number of taps or a certain total amount, the system may
          force a PIN-verified transaction to “reset” the counter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Offline approvals:</strong> Some small transactions might be approved locally by the card
          and terminal without live contact to the issuer, based on risk and rules.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These limits are set by a combination of regulations, network rules and issuer policies, and they can
        change over time or vary by country.
