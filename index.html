        <p class="hero-lead">
          NFC is the short-range radio layer that makes contactless payments possible. This page explains how the chip in your card or phone talks to the terminal, what data is exchanged, and how issuers use that information to approve or decline a transaction.

      <h2>What Is NFC in the Context of Credit Cards?</h2>
      <p>Near-field communication (NFC) is a very short-range wireless technology used to exchange small amounts of data between a card or device and a payment terminal. In contactless payments, NFC replaces the physical contact of inserting a chip or swiping a magnetic stripe.</p>
      <p>The NFC chip embedded in a card, phone or wearable follows strict standards so that terminals can recognize it, negotiate which application to use and securely request the information needed to start a payment. The goal is to keep the interaction fast while still supporting the same risk checks as traditional card present transactions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How NFC Talks to the Terminal During a Tap</h2>
      <p>When you bring a card or device within a few centimeters of the reader, the terminal creates an electromagnetic field. The NFC antenna in your card harvests a tiny amount of energy from this field and uses it to power the chip long enough to speak back to the terminal.</p>
      <p>The two sides exchange a series of short messages: first to agree on the communication mode, then to select a card application and finally to transmit a limited set of credentials and a dynamic cryptogram or token. This payload is then wrapped into a standard authorization request sent over the usual card network rails.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Data, Distance and Practical Security Boundaries</h2>
      <p>NFC operates at a very short range, typically a few centimeters. That limited distance, combined with strict timing rules, makes it difficult for someone standing several meters away to eavesdrop or conduct a relay attack without specialized equipment and careful setup.</p>
      <p>In addition, modern NFC payment flows rarely expose the full card number directly. Instead, they use dynamic cryptograms or tokenized credentials that become useless once the specific authorization is completed, shrinking the value of any intercepted data.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>NFC in Physical Cards vs Mobile Wallets</h2>
      <p>Physical contactless cards use NFC to share data that is tightly bound to the chip itself. Mobile wallets use the same NFC radio but pair it with tokenization and biometric checks, replacing the card number with a device-specific token and requiring fingerprint or face verification before the token can be used.</p>
      <p>From the terminal’s perspective, both types of tap look similar. The differences live in how credentials are stored and protected inside the card or device, and how much extra context the issuer receives about the device, wallet and authentication method used.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Limits, Compatibility and Real-World Behaviour</h2>
      <p>NFC payments depend on both the card and the terminal supporting the same standards. Older terminals may turn off contactless for certain transaction types, currencies or risk patterns, even when the card itself can handle it.</p>
      <p>Issuers and schemes also define contactless limits, where small NFC payments can flow without a PIN, while larger ones trigger additional checks. These rules can vary by country and can change over time as fraud data and regulation evolve.</p>
